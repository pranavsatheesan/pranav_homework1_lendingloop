# Case Study: Lending Loop

## Overview and Origin

* Name of Company: Lending Loop (LL) is Canada's first fully regulated peer-to-peer lending platform focused on small businesses. Lending Loop introduces both retail and institutional capital to small businesses through unsecured business term loans.Retail investors can use the online platform to evaluate loans based on credit risk grade (as recommended by LL models) and associated loan interest yield. Based on the risk appetite of the individual investor, investments (starting at a minimum of $100) can be made to fund in full or part various small business loans.

* When was the company incorporated?: 24 October 2016 registration was completed with Ontario Securities Commission (OSC) and other securities regulators

* Who are the founders of the company?: Cato Pastoll and Brandon Vlaar

* How did the idea for the company (or project) come about?: Peer to Peer lending was already gaining traction in 2015 in various jurisdictions including the US and UK. Canada's tightly regulated financial sector did not have any such companies at the time and an opportunity was seen to be a new entrant into the market. Only recently a new competitor has been approved for the market called GoPeer.

* How is the company funded? How much funding have they received?: LL was and is privately funded. Currently loans made to borrowers is provided by retail and institutional investors on the lending platform.

## Business Activities

* What specific financial problem is the company or project trying to solve?: LL provides unsecured loans to small business and other individual business owners. The business should be incorporated for at least prior to date of loan application. Typically the LL borrowers will find it harder to access traditional means of finance and lending due to inherent risk or credit worthiness of the business.

* Who is the company's intended customer? Is there any information about the market size of this set of customers?: The target base is small business and other individual business owners. An exact size for the market is not available. LL has facilitated loans in excess of 70 $MM to date to small business borrowers via its online platform.

* What solution does this company offer that their competitors do not or cannot offer? (What is the unfair advantage they utilize?): LL borrowers in general cannot access traditional means of loan finance due to inherent credit risk in the business. These borrowers are therefore charged a higher rate on the LL loans. As worldwide, loose monetary policy has led to lower interest rates which results in investors who are hungry for higher yields. Therefore retail and institutional investors are available to invest in such higher risk private loans. LL provides a platform where such lenders and directly assess and fund
higher risk borrowers.

* Which technologies are they currently using, and how are they implementing them?**: LL does not use any new sophisticated technology. Lending is facilitated through online website which has a database of loan requests and investors for the loans. Credit Risk rating for loan requests is performed using in house algorithms.

## Landscape

* What domain of the financial industry is the company in?: LL is in the small business loans market

* What have been the major trends and innovations of this domain over the last 5-10 years?: Peer to peer lending took off in many jurisdictions in the early 2010s. Canada did not have a player in this space till 2016 when LL arrived. Currently there is only one other competitor in the country (GoPeer). Recently in some jurisdictions, there is now prevalence of super apps (e.g Ant Financial) which provides everything from banking, wealth management, shopping, dining etc all from a single app. LL and other platforms may face competition from other big tech firms which wish to create their own super apps which provide a range of financial and other retail services.

* What are the other major companies in this domain?: In Canada, there is only one other competitor (GoPeer). LL was modeled based on a successful UK P2P lender -- Funding Circle.

## Results

* What has been the business impact of this company so far?: LL has facilitated loans in excess of 70 \$MM to date to small business borrowers via its online platform. Small Business owners with higher credit risk have now an additional avenue where they can obtain financing at lower yields compared to other payday type loan shops which charge interest rates similar to credit cards.

* What are some of the core metrics that companies in this domain use
to measure success? How is your company performing, based on these metrics?: LL does not provide financial performance details as it is a private firm. However many success stories of individual small business owners are provided on the website along with how the business founded by these borrowers serve the community. LL's activities also gained provincial attention when it was reported in the Globe and Mail that Ontario government would contribute $3-million over a two year period to loans funded on Lending Loop's platform.

* How is your company performing relative to competitors in the same domain?: LL till recently did not have any competition in Canada within the P2P lending segment. It has enjoyed a first mover advantage and impact of competition in the sector is yet to materialize.

## Recommendations

* If you were to advise the company, what products or services would you suggest they offer??**: LL should expand into other loan products (e.g Consumer Finance) and should even consider funding for secured loans. Finance in many parts of the world is now perform ed through super apps (e.g Ant Financial) which provides everything from banking, wealth management, shopping, dining etc all from a single app. LL should consider expansion along the value chain to other product segments on its platform.

* Why do you think that offering this product or service would benefit the company?: Consumer Finance lending from a risk perspective is similar compared to unsecured lending to a very small business. Instead of business income, the retail borrower will have to rely on employment related income for settling the liability. Risk assessment is also easier by accessing credit scores and previous re-payment behavior from credit unions.

* What technologies would this additional product or service utilize?: Expansion into Consumer Finance lending is cost effective as LL's existing platform can be leveraged (or used as is) from connecting investors with borrowers. The additional investment will be required on the credit side to rate the borrowers and obtain credit scores. However, this should be a relatively minor investment compared otherwise rolling out an entirely new platform. Additional investments will be required for transition to an App based platform which offers multiple products. This will require investment in secure databases for storing information, creation of an app itself, algorithms for pushing relevant products to the right consumers, expanded credit decisioning models etc

* Why are these technologies appropriate for your solution?: LL already has an established platform which is currently working. The cost effective approach will be to leverage this platform to the extent possible in easy pickings such as expansion into consumer and retail financing. Additional growth through app based multi product offerings, will require creation of an entirely new platform starting right from the consumer interface to the backend models. These solutions though appropriate will require significant investments. As Canada does not
have any operator in this space, LL can explore being a first mover in this segment too.
